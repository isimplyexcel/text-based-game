# text-based-game
"Train" is a text-based, one-player adventure game written in C++ for the command line.

The player can traverse the train and pick up items, one of which is required to win the game.

## Concepts
I finished this project after a two-part Introduction to Computer Science course that covered C++ and object-oriented programming.
I wanted to build something that would allow me to demonstrate understanding of the following concepts:
- Pointers
- Memory management
- Object composition and inheritance
- Polymorphism and virtual functions
- Linked Classes
- STL Containers

## To Run
Use `make` at the command line to compile.
`./train` to run.
